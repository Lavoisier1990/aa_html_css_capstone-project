        <h1>Architecture in the 20th century: looking back on different epochs</h1>
        <p>There are different definitions of what architecture is. From the first homes and shelters of our most ancient ancestors to the current buildings, full of technology, architecture has walked hand in hand with the human being and his environment, shaping different architectural styles in each period of history. New architectural styles are often related to the social, economic, and political developments of their time. This certainly holds true for the 20th century. Industrial and technological advancement changed the ways in which buildings were designed. The resulting concepts and characteristics continue to inform present-day projects. In terms of architecture, the 20th century spans three phases which all fall under the category of “modernism”:
          <ul>
            <li>Fathers of modernism: ca. 1900 to 1920,</li>
            <li>Modernism (also New Building or classical modernism): ca. 1920 to 1968,</li>
            <li>Postmodernism: ca. 1968 to date.</li>
          </ul>
        Each of these phases include different architectural movements that closely succeeded one another and frequently overlapped.

          <blockquote>“Architecture does not derive from a sum of lengths, widths and heights of the constructive elements that envelop the space, but emanates from the void itself, from the enveloped space, from the interior space, in which men die and live”.</blockquote><cite>Bruno Zevi, italian architect (1918-2000)</cite></p>

        <p>The twentieth century progressed largely characterized by the search for functionality and the importance of interior space, to the detriment of the ornamental work of the facade. Civil architecture was established as the true protagonist of the architectural movements, gaining special importance the urbanization and the blocks of houses, that go united to a great philosophical production. So Bauhaus or international style? Art nouveau or expressionism? Building trends of the modern era are not always easy to distinguish. For those interested in 20th-century architecture, here is an overview on the most important epochs and their special characteristics.</p>

      <section class="topic" id="art-nouveau">
        <h2>Art nouveau: geometrical shapes and floral elements</h2>
        <p>
          Art Nouveau is a late 19th and early 20th century aesthetic movement inspired by the natural world and defined by organic shapes and sinuous lines. This produced a highly expressive style of architecture, interior design, furniture, decor, glasswork, jewelry, and visual arts. Its broad influence allows for the creation of what is known as total works of art, where every element of a structure from its windows to its door handles to its decorative flourishes can be harmonized to create an immersive Art Nouveau style.
        </p>
        <p>Combining craftsmanship with creative expression, art nouveau became a precursor of modernist architecture in the 20th century. Thanks to the works of Antoni Gaudi, Otto Wagner, or Josef Hoffmann, this movement peaked between 1890 to 1910.
        Main features of art nouveau:
          <ul>
            <li>Art Nouveau style is inspired by the natural world, characterized by sinuous, sculptural, organic shapes, arches, curving lines, and sensual ornamentation.</li>
            <li>Common motifs include stylized versions of leaves, flowers, vines, insects, animals, and other natural elements.</li>
            <li>Decorative elements found on the inside and outside of buildings include intricate mosaic work, stained and curved glass, and decorative wrought iron.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

      <section class="topic" id="expressionism">
        <h2>Expressionism: pointed, rounded, jagged</h2>
        <p>
          Between 1910 and 1925, architects in Central and Northern Europe sought to turn away from the objective and rational approach of functionalism, which was gaining popularity at the time. The characteristics of the expressionist architecture formed in something more gothic rather than classic, which resulted in forms and shapes that are individualistic apart from the other architectural styles at that time. This produces a detachment from realism and more to a symbolic form from conceptual representation.</p>
        <p>
          The style was characterised by an early-modernist adoption of novel materials, formal innovation, and very unusual massing, sometimes inspired by natural biomorphic forms, sometimes by the new technical possibilities offered by the mass production of brick, steel and especially glass. Famous representatives of expressionist architecture in the early 20th-century were Erich Mendelsohn, Fritz Höger, Hans Poelzig, and Bruno Taut.
          Main features of expressionism:
          <ul>
            <li>Distortion of form for an emotional effect.</li>
            <li>Subordination of realism to symbolic or stylistic expression of inner experience.</li>
            <li>Profusion of works on paper, and models, with discovery and representations of concepts more important than pragmatic finished products.</li>
            <li>Themes of natural romantic phenomena, such as caves, mountains, lightning, crystal and rock formations. As such it is more mineral and elemental than florid and organic which characterized its close contemporary Art Nouveau.</li>
            <li>Though a movement in Europe, expressionism is as eastern as western. It draws as much from Moorish, Islamic, Egyptian, and Indian art and architecture as from Roman or Greek.</li>
            <li>Conception of architecture as a work of art.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

      <section class="topic" id="functionalism">
        <h2>Functionalism: simple and matter-of-fact</h2>
        <p>The term “functionalism“ refers to a novel approach that provided the basis for several architectural epochs of the 20th century. It is the principle that buildings should be designed based solely on their purpose and function. Designers and architects were focusing on the purpose and usefulness of buildings: pioneers such as Le Corbusier followed a concept informed by reason and logic. During the construction period after World War II, functionalism gained importance for urban developments, as part of the wave of Modernism. Apartment blocks made from reinforced concrete thus became the precursors of prefabricated high-rises.</p>

        <p>
        Its ideas were largely inspired by a desire to build a new and better world for the people, as broadly and strongly expressed by the social and political movements of Europe after the extremely devastating world war. In this respect, functionalist architecture is often linked with the ideas of socialism and modern humanism. A new slight addition to this new wave of architecture was that not only should buildings and houses be designed around the purpose of functionality, but that architecture should also be used as a means to physically create a better world and a better life for people in the broadest sense. This new functionalist architecture had the strongest impact in Czechoslovakia, Germany, Poland, the USSR and the Netherlands, and from the 1930s also in Scandinavia and Finland.
        Main features of functionalism:
        <ul>
          <li>Designed based on the function and structural necessity of the building.</li>
          <li>Disregard of decorative and ornamental elements as a form of artistic expression of the architect.</li>
          <li>Ornamentations are simply the raw beauty of the structure enhanced by materials and consideration for human comforts.</li>
          <li>Minimalist appearance; modern objectivity.</li>
          <li>Focus on technical, practical aspects producing straight-lined, neutral shapes.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

      <section class="topic" id="bauhaus">
        <h2>Bauhaus: less is more</h2>
        <p>The so-called Bauhaus brought functionalism to the forefront at an international scale. What began as an experiment evolved into Germany's most influential building style. Even though the Bauhaus school only existed between 1919 and 1933, it shaped 20th-century architecture like no other. The most well-known representatives are former lecturers including Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Marcel Breuer, along with founding father Walter Gropius. Today, Bauhaus architecture is more popular than ever among builders. Based on the motto "form follows function", it inspires many contemporary projects.</p>

        <p>Several specific features are identified in Bauhaus forms and shapes: simple geometric shapes like rectangles and spheres, without elaborate decorations. Buildings, furniture, and fonts often feature rounded corners and sometimes rounded walls. Some buildings are characterized by rectangular features, for example protruding balconies with flat, chunky railings facing the street, and long banks of windows.Since the Bauhaus movement focuses on simplicity and industrialism, it most often tries to incorporate the fewest different materials possible, all of which are considered industrial, modern materials.
        Main features of Bauhaus:
          <ul>
            <li>Functional shapes: Bauhaus design features little to no embellishment or ornamentation, instead drawing attention to the streamlined design, geometrical and cubic shapes, clear structure and linear surfaces. “Form follows function” and “less is more”.</li>
            <li>It attempts to unify individual artistic vision, science, and craftsmanship with the principles of mass production and emphasis on function.</li>
            <li>Among the essential tenets of Bauhaus design is integrating the school's techniques into every element of life, including city design, street corners, building architecture, furniture design, appliances, eating utensils, and typography.</li>
            <li>Simple, complementary and basic colour schemes: Bauhaus design aims for cohesion and simplicity, so architectural color schemes are often limited to basic industrial colors like white, gray, and beige. In interior design, primary colors are often used.</li>
            <li>Since the Bauhaus movement focuses on simplicity and industrialism, it most often tries to incorporate the fewest different materials possible, all of which are considered industrial, modern materials.</li>
            <li>Balanced asymmetry: Bauhaus architecture and design aimed for visual balance through asymmetry. (Symmetry was considered too industrial without any artistic heart.) As a result, Bauhaus designers worked to unite and balance buildings and rooms by incorporating the same elements throughout (for instance, the same materials and shapes, or repeating colors) without making both sides the same.</li>
          </ul>

      <section class="topic" id="international-style">
        <h2>International style: steel, glass, unplastered concrete</h2>
        <p>Beginning in the 1920s, this movement manifested the concept of objective, purposeful architecture though various 20th-century constructions across the globe. International-style skyscrapers and office complexes can still be found in many metropolitan areas in Europa and North America. The style is characterized by an emphasis on volume over mass, the use of lightweight, mass-produced, industrial materials, rejection of all ornament and colour, repetitive modular forms, and the use of flat surfaces, typically alternating with areas of glass." Some researchers consider the International Style as one of the attempts to create an ideal and utilitarian form.</p>

        <p>However, International Style architecture demonstrates a unity of approach and general principles: lightweight structures, new materials, a modular system, an open plan, a frame structure, and the use of simple geometric shapes. When people describe the modernist movement as a whole, they broadly reference the steel and glass skyscrapers which dot many of our cities' skylines, or more specifically, the International Style that once emerged from Europe after World War I. The International Style represented technological and industrial progress and a renaissance of social constructs that would forever influence the way that we think about the use of space across all scales. Often designed as politically charged buildings seeking to make a statement towards totalitarian governments, many architects who influenced the style moved to the United States after World War II, paving the way for some of the most iconic buildings and skyscrapers to be built in the 20th century.
          Main features of the International Style
          <ul>
            <li>There was an emphasis on volume over mass, through the use of pilotis, or a point-support structure of thin columns of steel or reinforced concrete. This enabled the free plan, by freeing up floor space for maximum flexibility.</li>
            <li>The exposure of buildings' construction with unvarnished honesty, and the glorification of lightweight, mass-produced modern industrial materials: chiefly, steel, concrete, and glass.</li>
            <li>Often called "minimalist" architecture, International Style buildings are well-known for the way they seem to strip away all extraneous ornament from the structure, leading to an extreme blurring of interior and exterior space.</li>
            <li>A radical simplification of form into repetitive modular forms.</li>
            <li>The use of flat surfaces, typically alternating with areas of glass.</li>
          </ul>

      <section class="topic" id="organic-architecture">
        <h2>Organic architecture: inspired by nature</h2>
        <p>Placing humans centre-stage, organic architecture is also known as “anthroposophic architecture”. This style aims to design buildings that authentically blend into their surrounding scenery. Following Rudolf Steiner, the founder of anthroposophy, 20th-century architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Antonio Gaudí, and Hugo Häring drew inspiration from nature between 1920 and 1970. It refers to a category of architecture that is in close association with nature (Harmony between nature and built habitat). Organic architecture is achieved by integrating the structure into the site and natural fabric to create a single entity.</p>

        <p>The objective of organic architecture is simple: honor nature. In this way it is less of a style and more of an ideology—buildings should not take away from their natural surroundings, but should rather be integrated within and in service to their landscapes. The term is often credited to Frank Lloyd Wright, though as the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation explains, it was a concept he struggled to fully define throughout his lifetime. Even to this day there are varying interpretations: Some see it as the use of natural materials or an emphasis on indoor-outdoor living, while others understand it as structures designed following forms found in nature. “All of these interpretations have a basis in Wright's words, and of course in his works, and so organic architecture is at once all of these things,” the foundation explains.
          Main features of organic archutecture:
          <ul>
            <li>Little ornamentation: Organic design eschews flourishes or embellishments for clean lines and more natural textures and nature-inspired motifs—for example, a coffee table that highlights the natural pattern of the wood. The building elements (doors, windows, and furniture) should blend with the ornamentation of the structure.</li>
            <li>The structure should appear as if it was created by nature itself (The building should appear to grow from the site).</li>
            <li>Neutral or muted colors: To complement their natural surroundings, organic modern-style homes often feature a neutral color palette, such as white walls and area rugs in solid colors that reflect earth and wood tones. The color of nature should inspire the main coloring of the building to focus on natural aesthetics.</li>
            <li>Minimalist forms: An organic modern living room, dining room, or other interior boasting organic home decor might feature understated, minimalist furniture with straight lines or simple curves, such as side tables or pendant lights in simple shapes, crafted from only a few components.</li>
            <li>Open floor plans: Organic design aims to suggest the wide-open spaces of the outdoors and bring natural elements inside. Organic modern homes therefore commonly feature open floor plans and indoor-outdoor living spaces to reinforce a feeling of freedom for inhabitants.</li>
            <li>Simple materials: Organic product design utilizes natural materials where possible, such as natural wood, rattan, jute, seagrass, and others. Designers complement these with other simple materials, like concrete, glass, steel, and cast-iron.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

      <section class="topic" id="postmodernism">
        <h2>Postmodernism: eclectic and colourful</h2>
        <p>Postmodernism is an eclectic, colourful style of architecture and the decorative arts that appeared from the late 1970s and continues in some form today. It emerged as a reaction to Modernism and the Modern Movement and the dogmas associated with it. By the 1970s Modernism had begun to seem elitist and exclusive, despite its democratic intentions. The failure of building methods and materials and alienating housing estates was a focus for architects and critics in the early 1970s.</p>

        <p>In his published works, Robert Venturi deconstructed the signs and symbols of the Las Vegas strip and divided buildings into 'ducks', the sculptural buildings that embodied their message within the structure, and the 'decorated shed', which used signs to communicate its message. In practice, it meant the rediscovery of the various meanings contained within the mainly classical architecture of the past and applying them to modern structures. The result was an architecture that embodied historical allusion and dashes of whimsy. In this context, the postmodern becomes, first of all, a way of playing against the rules: a form of avant-garde putting forward the unexpected and the estranged against the dictatorship of the commonplace. From this point of view, to be postmodern does not mean to be part of a new age, or refer to a particular style; it is the ethos of questioning the unsatisfactory circumstances of today, without refusing either the presence of past or the understanding of today's new cultural conditions and technologies.
          Main features of postmodernism:
          <ul>
            <li>Complexity and contradiction: Rejects the notion of "pure" or "perfect" form, and draws form all available methods, materials, forms and colours. Often had curved forms, decorative elements, asymmetry, bright colours, and features often borrowed from earlier periods. Colours and textures were unrelated to the structure or function of the building.</li>
            <li>Fragmentation: often breaks large buildings into several different structures and forms, sometimes representing different functions of those parts of the building. With the use of different materials and styles, a single building can appear like a small town or village.</li>
            <li>Asymmetric and oblique forms: Asymmetric forms are one of the trademarks of postmodernism. They are rarely symmetric, balanced and orderly. Oblique buildings which tilt, lean, and seem about to fall over are common.</li>
            <li>Polychromy: Color is an important element in many postmodern buildings; to give the façades variety and personality, colored glass is sometimes used, or ceramic tiles, or stone. The buildings of Mexican architect Luis Barragan offer bright sunlight color that give life to the forms. </li>
            <li>Humor: a style which put its accent on the texture, the surface, and style to the detriment of the content, which adored exaggeration, and things which were not what they seemed. Postmodern architecture sometimes used the same sense of theatricality, sense of the absurd and exaggeration of forms. </li>
          </ul>
