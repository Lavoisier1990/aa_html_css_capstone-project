        <h1>Architecture in the 20th century: looking back on different epochs</h1>
        <p>There are different definitions of what architecture is. From the first homes and shelters of our most ancient ancestors to the current buildings, full of technology, architecture has walked hand in hand with the human being and his environment, shaping different architectural styles in each period of history. New architectural styles are often related to the social, economic, and political developments of their time. This certainly holds true for the 20th century. Industrial and technological advancement changed the ways in which buildings were designed. The resulting concepts and characteristics continue to inform present-day projects. In terms of architecture, the 20th century spans three phases which all fall under the category of “modernism”:
          <ul>
            <li>Fathers of modernism: ca. 1900 to 1920,</li>
            <li>Modernism (also New Building or classical modernism): ca. 1920 to 1968,</li>
            <li>Postmodernism: ca. 1968 to date.</li>
          </ul>
        Each of these phases include different architectural movements that closely succeeded one another and frequently overlapped.

          <blockquote>“Architecture does not derive from a sum of lengths, widths and heights of the constructive elements that envelop the space, but emanates from the void itself, from the enveloped space, from the interior space, in which men die and live”.</blockquote><cite>Bruno Zevi, italian architect (1918-2000)</cite></p>

        <p>The twentieth century progressed largely characterized by the search for functionality and the importance of interior space, to the detriment of the ornamental work of the facade. Civil architecture was established as the true protagonist of the architectural movements, gaining special importance the urbanization and the blocks of houses, that go united to a great philosophical production. So Bauhaus or international style? Art nouveau or expressionism? Building trends of the modern era are not always easy to distinguish. For those interested in 20th-century architecture, here is an overview on the most important epochs and their special characteristics.</p>

      <section class="topic" id="art-nouveau">
        <h2>Art nouveau: geometrical shapes and floral elements</h2>
        <p>
          Art Nouveau is a late 19th and early 20th century aesthetic movement inspired by the natural world and defined by organic shapes and sinuous lines. This produced a highly expressive style of architecture, interior design, furniture, decor, glasswork, jewelry, and visual arts. Its broad influence allows for the creation of what is known as total works of art, where every element of a structure from its windows to its door handles to its decorative flourishes can be harmonized to create an immersive Art Nouveau style.
        </p>
        <p>Combining craftsmanship with creative expression, art nouveau became a precursor of modernist architecture in the 20th century. Thanks to the works of Antoni Gaudi, Otto Wagner, or Josef Hoffmann, this movement peaked between 1890 to 1910.
        Main features of art nouveau:
          <ul>
            <li>Art Nouveau style is inspired by the natural world, characterized by sinuous, sculptural, organic shapes, arches, curving lines, and sensual ornamentation.</li>
            <li>Common motifs include stylized versions of leaves, flowers, vines, insects, animals, and other natural elements.</li>
            <li>Decorative elements found on the inside and outside of buildings include intricate mosaic work, stained and curved glass, and decorative wrought iron.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

      <section class="topic" id="expressionism">
        <h2>Expressionism: pointed, rounded, jagged</h2>
        <p>
          Between 1910 and 1925, architects in Central and Northern Europe sought to turn away from the objective and rational approach of functionalism, which was gaining popularity at the time. The characteristics of the expressionist architecture formed in something more gothic rather than classic, which resulted in forms and shapes that are individualistic apart from the other architectural styles at that time. This produces a detachment from realism and more to a symbolic form from conceptual representation.</p>
        <p>
          The style was characterised by an early-modernist adoption of novel materials, formal innovation, and very unusual massing, sometimes inspired by natural biomorphic forms, sometimes by the new technical possibilities offered by the mass production of brick, steel and especially glass. Famous representatives of expressionist architecture in the early 20th-century were Erich Mendelsohn, Fritz Höger, Hans Poelzig, and Bruno Taut.
          Main features of expressionism:
          <ul>
            <li>Distortion of form for an emotional effect.</li>
            <li>Subordination of realism to symbolic or stylistic expression of inner experience.</li>
            <li>Profusion of works on paper, and models, with discovery and representations of concepts more important than pragmatic finished products.</li>
            <li>Themes of natural romantic phenomena, such as caves, mountains, lightning, crystal and rock formations. As such it is more mineral and elemental than florid and organic which characterized its close contemporary Art Nouveau.</li>
            <li>Though a movement in Europe, expressionism is as eastern as western. It draws as much from Moorish, Islamic, Egyptian, and Indian art and architecture as from Roman or Greek.</li>
            <li>Conception of architecture as a work of art.</li>
          </ul>
