        <h1>Architecture in the 20th century: looking back on different epochs</h1>
        <p>There are different definitions of what architecture is. From the first homes and shelters of our most ancient ancestors to the current buildings, full of technology, architecture has walked hand in hand with the human being and his environment, shaping different architectural styles in each period of history. New architectural styles are often related to the social, economic, and political developments of their time. This certainly holds true for the 20th century. Industrial and technological advancement changed the ways in which buildings were designed. The resulting concepts and characteristics continue to inform present-day projects. In terms of architecture, the 20th century spans three phases which all fall under the category of “modernism”:
          <ul>
            <li>Fathers of modernism: ca. 1900 to 1920,</li>
            <li>Modernism (also New Building or classical modernism): ca. 1920 to 1968,</li>
            <li>Postmodernism: ca. 1968 to date.</li>
          </ul>
        Each of these phases include different architectural movements that closely succeeded one another and frequently overlapped.

          <blockquote>“Architecture does not derive from a sum of lengths, widths and heights of the constructive elements that envelop the space, but emanates from the void itself, from the enveloped space, from the interior space, in which men die and live”.</blockquote><cite>Bruno Zevi, italian architect (1918-2000)</cite></p>

        <p>The twentieth century progressed largely characterized by the search for functionality and the importance of interior space, to the detriment of the ornamental work of the facade. Civil architecture was established as the true protagonist of the architectural movements, gaining special importance the urbanization and the blocks of houses, that go united to a great philosophical production. So Bauhaus or international style? Art nouveau or expressionism? Building trends of the modern era are not always easy to distinguish. For those interested in 20th-century architecture, here is an overview on the most important epochs and their special characteristics.</p>

      <section class="topic" id="art-nouveau">
        <h2>Art nouveau: geometrical shapes and floral elements</h2>
        <p>
          Art Nouveau is a late 19th and early 20th century aesthetic movement inspired by the natural world and defined by organic shapes and sinuous lines. This produced a highly expressive style of architecture, interior design, furniture, decor, glasswork, jewelry, and visual arts. Its broad influence allows for the creation of what is known as total works of art, where every element of a structure from its windows to its door handles to its decorative flourishes can be harmonized to create an immersive Art Nouveau style.
        </p>
        <p>Combining craftsmanship with creative expression, art nouveau became a precursor of modernist architecture in the 20th century. Thanks to the works of Antoni Gaudi, Otto Wagner, or Josef Hoffmann, this movement peaked between 1890 to 1910.
        Main features of art nouveau:
          <ul>
            <li>Art Nouveau style is inspired by the natural world, characterized by sinuous, sculptural, organic shapes, arches, curving lines, and sensual ornamentation.</li>
            <li>Common motifs include stylized versions of leaves, flowers, vines, insects, animals, and other natural elements.</li>
            <li>Decorative elements found on the inside and outside of buildings include intricate mosaic work, stained and curved glass, and decorative wrought iron.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

      <section class="topic" id="expressionism">
        <h2>Expressionism: pointed, rounded, jagged</h2>
        <p>
          Between 1910 and 1925, architects in Central and Northern Europe sought to turn away from the objective and rational approach of functionalism, which was gaining popularity at the time. The characteristics of the expressionist architecture formed in something more gothic rather than classic, which resulted in forms and shapes that are individualistic apart from the other architectural styles at that time. This produces a detachment from realism and more to a symbolic form from conceptual representation.</p>
        <p>
          The style was characterised by an early-modernist adoption of novel materials, formal innovation, and very unusual massing, sometimes inspired by natural biomorphic forms, sometimes by the new technical possibilities offered by the mass production of brick, steel and especially glass. Famous representatives of expressionist architecture in the early 20th-century were Erich Mendelsohn, Fritz Höger, Hans Poelzig, and Bruno Taut.
          Main features of expressionism:
          <ul>
            <li>Distortion of form for an emotional effect.</li>
            <li>Subordination of realism to symbolic or stylistic expression of inner experience.</li>
            <li>Profusion of works on paper, and models, with discovery and representations of concepts more important than pragmatic finished products.</li>
            <li>Themes of natural romantic phenomena, such as caves, mountains, lightning, crystal and rock formations. As such it is more mineral and elemental than florid and organic which characterized its close contemporary Art Nouveau.</li>
            <li>Though a movement in Europe, expressionism is as eastern as western. It draws as much from Moorish, Islamic, Egyptian, and Indian art and architecture as from Roman or Greek.</li>
            <li>Conception of architecture as a work of art.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

      <section class="topic" id="functionalism">
        <h2>Functionalism: simple and matter-of-fact</h2>
        <p>The term “functionalism“ refers to a novel approach that provided the basis for several architectural epochs of the 20th century. It is the principle that buildings should be designed based solely on their purpose and function. Designers and architects were focusing on the purpose and usefulness of buildings: pioneers such as Le Corbusier followed a concept informed by reason and logic. During the construction period after World War II, functionalism gained importance for urban developments, as part of the wave of Modernism. Apartment blocks made from reinforced concrete thus became the precursors of prefabricated high-rises.</p>

        <p>
        Its ideas were largely inspired by a desire to build a new and better world for the people, as broadly and strongly expressed by the social and political movements of Europe after the extremely devastating world war. In this respect, functionalist architecture is often linked with the ideas of socialism and modern humanism. A new slight addition to this new wave of architecture was that not only should buildings and houses be designed around the purpose of functionality, but that architecture should also be used as a means to physically create a better world and a better life for people in the broadest sense. This new functionalist architecture had the strongest impact in Czechoslovakia, Germany, Poland, the USSR and the Netherlands, and from the 1930s also in Scandinavia and Finland.
        Main features of functionalism:
        <ul>
          <li>Designed based on the function and structural necessity of the building.</li>
          <li>Disregard of decorative and ornamental elements as a form of artistic expression of the architect.</li>
          <li>Ornamentations are simply the raw beauty of the structure enhanced by materials and consideration for human comforts.</li>
          <li>Minimalist appearance; modern objectivity.</li>
          <li>Focus on technical, practical aspects producing straight-lined, neutral shapes.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

      <section class="topic" id="bauhaus">
        <h2>Bauhaus: less is more</h2>
        <p>The so-called Bauhaus brought functionalism to the forefront at an international scale. What began as an experiment evolved into Germany's most influential building style. Even though the Bauhaus school only existed between 1919 and 1933, it shaped 20th-century architecture like no other. The most well-known representatives are former lecturers including Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Marcel Breuer, along with founding father Walter Gropius. Today, Bauhaus architecture is more popular than ever among builders. Based on the motto "form follows function", it inspires many contemporary projects.</p>

        <p>Several specific features are identified in Bauhaus forms and shapes: simple geometric shapes like rectangles and spheres, without elaborate decorations. Buildings, furniture, and fonts often feature rounded corners and sometimes rounded walls. Some buildings are characterized by rectangular features, for example protruding balconies with flat, chunky railings facing the street, and long banks of windows.Since the Bauhaus movement focuses on simplicity and industrialism, it most often tries to incorporate the fewest different materials possible, all of which are considered industrial, modern materials.
        Main features of Bauhaus:
          <ul>
            <li>Functional shapes: Bauhaus design features little to no embellishment or ornamentation, instead drawing attention to the streamlined design, geometrical and cubic shapes, clear structure and linear surfaces. “Form follows function” and “less is more”.</li>
            <li>It attempts to unify individual artistic vision, science, and craftsmanship with the principles of mass production and emphasis on function.</li>
            <li>Among the essential tenets of Bauhaus design is integrating the school's techniques into every element of life, including city design, street corners, building architecture, furniture design, appliances, eating utensils, and typography.</li>
            <li>Simple, complementary and basic colour schemes: Bauhaus design aims for cohesion and simplicity, so architectural color schemes are often limited to basic industrial colors like white, gray, and beige. In interior design, primary colors are often used.</li>
            <li>Since the Bauhaus movement focuses on simplicity and industrialism, it most often tries to incorporate the fewest different materials possible, all of which are considered industrial, modern materials.</li>
            <li>Balanced asymmetry: Bauhaus architecture and design aimed for visual balance through asymmetry. (Symmetry was considered too industrial without any artistic heart.) As a result, Bauhaus designers worked to unite and balance buildings and rooms by incorporating the same elements throughout (for instance, the same materials and shapes, or repeating colors) without making both sides the same.</li>
          </ul>
