<p>Expressionism is the way of expressing something in and around something that you feel emotionally, from all the things that happen phenomenally. This is one of the movements in architecture in the 20th century, mainly in Europe, where at that time people fought in the World War I, including the architects at that time. The political and social problems also influence the architect, such places like Germany, Austria, and Denmark. Many famous architects are involved in this movement, such as , Bruno Taut, Erich Mendelsohn, Walter Gropius, Mies van der Rohe and Hans Poelzig.

The characteristics of the expressionist architecture forms in something more gothic rather than classic, which resulted in forms and shapes that are individualistic from the other forms of architecture around that time, its detachment to realism and more to a symbolic form from conceptual representation. The representation of the forms and shapes are from the emotional feeling that the architects feel, a more bold way of showing what they feel, a more frontal way by showing forms in their buildings.

Materials used in this movement of architecture  the representation first rather than function, materials which have a poetic expression, and to unify the buildings into making it a monolithic design. Bricks, steel and especially glass is used, according to Paul Scheerbart “Coloured glass destroys hatred”,”Without a glass palace life is a burden”,”Glass brings us a new era, building in brick only does us harm”- inscriptions on the 1914 Werkbund Glass Pavilion.

This kind of movement, inspires many others and the legacy continues until now. Art deco and Neo Expressionism is one of the branch of expressionst architecture from the past. Such architects like Frank Gehry, developed architecture from the sense of expressionism, being individualistic from the other surroundings, expressing emotional values.

What is the point of expressionism?

To express emotionally, to publish to the world and let them know what we feel in a symbolic and poetic way.</p>
