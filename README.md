# aa_html_css_capstone-project
This is an adaptation of a short project with the App Academy Open Software Engineering Course. At this point, we were consolidating skills learnt in HTML and CSS. It would be my very first website. We would learn dense and more complex frameworks later on in the program but it would be beneficial to be master more traditional methods to create complex structures.

We were to choose the topic, theme, or purpose of our choosing for this project. Make a profile site, fan page for our favorite band, team, or show, a site all about our pet - whatever we would be familiar enough with to show off to friends and family.

At a minimum, the site had to have the elements and features listed below.

We could add to this, by starting small and satisfying these conditions first and expanding afterwards. It's much better to make a small site that is complete than succumb to feature creep and end up with a large site that is unfinished. We would then deploy it with Netlify.

These were the stories...

Each page must be appropriately and pleasantly styled using CSS.

This was not an academic exercise. The purpose of this page was to display the skills learnt in the course so far. Below are all the links from which I gathered information.
